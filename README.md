# Matei Oprea


Hi 👋, I'm Matei Oprea – a software developer currently working at @okapidev. I usually write the code you're afraid to 😁.

Been contributing to @microsoft **Project Oxford Node** and @torvalds **Linux Kernel** in the past (check my Pinned repos). 

I code in: 

- Javascript for React/Node apps
- Swift for iOS/MacOS apps
- Kotlin for Android Apps

## My passions: 


If I'm not on my Mac to write code, I'm usually in the studio making music. 

I know how to play a piano and how to make a Pop hit. 

Fun facts: 

🚀 Over 1M plays on my personal [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/euopreamateiro)

🚀 Over 15M plays on YouTube/Spotify/Apple Music for the music I produced
